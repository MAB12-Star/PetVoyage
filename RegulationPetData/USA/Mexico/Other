    <h1>Travel Requirements for Other Pets (Birds, Small Mammals, etc.) from the United States to Mexico</h1>

    <h2>1. Health Certificate</h2>
    <p>If you are traveling to Mexico with pets other than dogs or cats (such as birds, small mammals, or reptiles), you may require a health certificate from a licensed veterinarian. The health certificate should confirm that the pet is free from contagious diseases and parasites.</p>

    <h2>2. Species-Specific Requirements</h2>
    <p>The regulations for bringing other types of pets, such as birds or exotic animals, may vary based on the species. It's important to contact Mexican authorities (SENASICA) ahead of time to confirm specific requirements.</p>

    <h2>3. Inspection Upon Arrival</h2>
    <p>Your pet will be inspected by the Mexican Agricultural Health Authority (SENASICA) upon entry into Mexico. If your pet is found to have signs of illness or parasites, treatment may be provided at the ownerâ€™s expense.</p>

    <h2>4. Special Considerations for Birds</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Birds may require additional permits or certifications to prevent the spread of diseases such as avian influenza.</li>
        <li>Contact SENASICA for specific information on traveling with birds or exotic pets.</li>
    </ul>
