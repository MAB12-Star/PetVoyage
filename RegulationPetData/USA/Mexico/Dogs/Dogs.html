    <h1>Dog Travel Requirements from the United States to Mexico</h1>

    <h2>1. Rabies Vaccination</h2>
    <p>Your dog must have been vaccinated against rabies at least 15 days prior to entering Mexico. The rabies vaccination certificate must include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dog's identification (name, breed, age)</li>
        <li>Rabies vaccine manufacturer</li>
        <li>Vaccination date</li>
        <li>Vaccine expiration date</li>
        <li>Veterinarianâ€™s signature</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Health Certificate</h2>
    <p>Currently, a health certificate is no longer required for dogs entering Mexico from the United States. However, the dog must be free of any contagious diseases or visible parasites (such as fleas, ticks, or worms).</p>

    <h2>3. External and Internal Parasites Treatment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Your dog must be treated for both external (fleas and ticks) and internal parasites (intestinal worms) before traveling to Mexico.</li>
        <li>Any signs of parasites on arrival in Mexico will result in treatment at the owner's expense, carried out by Mexican authorities (SENASICA).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Inspection Upon Arrival</h2>
    <p>At the point of entry into Mexico (airport or border crossing), your dog will be inspected by the Mexican Agricultural Health Authority (SENASICA) to ensure it is free of infectious diseases and parasites.</p>
