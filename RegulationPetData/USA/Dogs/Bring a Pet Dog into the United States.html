    <h1>Requirements for Bringing Dogs into the USA from Mexico and Canada</h1>

    <h2>Rabies Vaccination Requirements</h2>
    <p>All dogs imported into the United States, including those from Mexico and Canada, must meet the rabies vaccination requirements set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Below are the key points based on the country of origin:</p>

    <h3>1. Dogs from Mexico</h3>
    <p>Mexico is classified as a high-risk country for rabies. Therefore, the following requirements apply for dogs entering the United States from Mexico:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All dogs must be vaccinated against rabies.</li>
        <li>Dogs must have a valid rabies vaccination certificate. The certificate must include the following details:
            <ul>
                <li>Dog’s identification and age</li>
                <li>Rabies vaccine manufacturer</li>
                <li>Vaccination date</li>
                <li>Vaccine expiration date</li>
                <li>Veterinarian’s signature</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Importers must submit an <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/importation/dog-import-permit.html" target="_blank">Import Permit</a> from the CDC, which must be approved before arrival in the USA.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more detailed information, visit the official CDC page: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/importation/dogs/rabies-free-low-risk-countries.html" target="_blank">CDC - Rabies-Free and Low-Risk Countries</a>.</p>

    <h3>2. Dogs from Canada</h3>
    <p>Canada is classified as a rabies-free country. However, some regulations still apply:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>While Canada is a rabies-free country, a rabies vaccination certificate may still be required depending on the U.S. state the dog is entering.</li>
        <li>Dogs must be in good health and may be subject to inspection upon arrival at the U.S. border.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Additional APHIS Requirements</h2>
    <p>In addition to CDC rabies requirements, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) may have specific regulations for dogs entering the United States from other countries, including Mexico and Canada.</p>

    <h3>1. Health Certificate</h3>
    <p>Dogs imported into the U.S. may require a health certificate issued by a veterinarian. This certificate must confirm that the dog is free from any infectious diseases, such as screwworm and foot-and-mouth disease.</p>

    <h3>2. Quarantine</h3>
    <p>If a dog shows signs of illness or comes from a country affected by certain diseases (such as screwworm or foot-and-mouth disease), the dog may be subject to quarantine until it is deemed healthy for entry.</p>

    <h3>3. Screwworm and Foot-and-Mouth Disease</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dogs coming from regions affected by screwworm must have a certificate issued by a veterinary official stating that the dog has been inspected and is free from screwworm.</li>
        <li>Dogs from foot-and-mouth disease regions must be bathed, and bedding must be free from dirt, hay, or straw.</li>
    </ul>
