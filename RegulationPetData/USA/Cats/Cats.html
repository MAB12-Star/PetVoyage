    <h1>Import Requirements for Cats - United States</h1>

    <h2>General Requirements</h2>
    <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) requires that cats appear healthy upon arrival to the United States. Cats are subject to inspection at ports of entry and may be denied entry if they show evidence of a zoonotic disease. If a cat appears to be ill, further examination by a licensed veterinarian at the owner's expense might be required before the cat is allowed to enter the United States.</p>

    <p>Cats are not required to have proof of rabies vaccination for importation into the United States. However, CDC recommends that all cats be vaccinated against rabies, and your U.S. destination may have additional requirements.</p>

    <p>All cats arriving in the state of Hawaii and the territory of Guam, even from the U.S. mainland, are subject to locally imposed quarantine requirements.</p>

    <h2>APHIS Veterinary Services</h2>
    <p>APHIS Veterinary Services does not have any animal health requirements related to bringing (importing) a pet cat into the United States from a foreign country. See below for other requirements for bringing pet cats into the United States from another country.</p>

    <h2>Other Federal Agency Requirements</h2>
    <p>Check with the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/importation/bringing-an-animal-into-the-us/index.html" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> and the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/" target="_blank">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a>. These agencies may have regulations related to importing a cat into the United States.</p>

    <h2>U.S. State and Territory Requirements</h2>
    <p>Domestic movement requirements are set by the receiving state or territory. Visit the <a href="https://www.nasda.org/about-nasda/state-agriculture-departments/" target="_blank">National Association of State Departments of Agriculture</a> to find your destination's agriculture department and check its website for requirements.</p>

    <p>For questions or clarification on any of the requirements, contact the state or territorial veterinarian's office.</p>
