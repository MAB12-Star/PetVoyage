Ensure a safe and seamless experience for your pet when they are traveling internationally or with a Delta partner airline.\nCarry-On Pets\nSmall dogs, cats and household birds can travel in the cabin for a one-way fee that is collected at check-in. The pet must be able to fit in a soft-sided ventilated pet kennel that will go underneath the seat directly in front of you.\n\nPlease review the following requirements to ensure a safe and healthy flight with a small pet traveling as a carry-on:\n\nYour pet must be at least 8 weeks old for domestic travel.\nYour pet dog must be 6 months old if traveling to the U.S. from another country and a pet cat must be at least 16 weeks old.\nYour pet must be at least 15 weeks old when traveling to the European Union.\n1 pet is permitted per kennel with the following exceptions:\n1 female cat or dog may travel with her un-weaned litter if the litter is between 8 weeks and 6 months of age. There is no limit on the number of animals in the litter as long as they can fit safely in the kennel.\n2 pets of the same breed and size between the ages of 8 weeks and 6 months may be allowed to travel in 1 kennel, as long as they are small enough to fit into a single kennel and are compatible. If the pets are allowed to travel in 1 kennel, they will be charged as 1 pet.\nPets in kennels will count as your 1 carry-on item.

If your pet meets the above requirements and you have a reservation, please contact Delta Reservations as soon as possible to book your pet. We also ask that you have your pet’s kennel dimensions (length, width and height) available when you call.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor flights operated by our partner airlines, please verify their specific policies regarding in-cabin animal transport.\nCarry-On Kennel Requirements\nBe sure to check the aircraft dimensions of your flight to ensure your pet’s kennel will fit underneath the seat directly in front of you.\n\nYour pet and kennel must also adhere to the following requirements:\n\nYour pet must be small enough to fit comfortably in a kennel with the ability to move around without touching or sticking out from the sides.\nThe kennel must fit underneath the seat directly in front of you.\nThe soft-sided kennel must be leak-proof and have ventilation openings on 3 sides for domestic travel and 4 sides for international travel.\nThe maximum carry-on kennel dimensions are determined by the aircraft dimensions of your flight, as the under-seat space varies by aircraft. Delta recommends a soft-sided kennel with maximum dimensions of 18” x 11” x 11” since this fits most aircraft types.\nYour pet must remain inside the kennel with the door secured while in a Delta boarding area, during boarding and deplaning, while in a Delta Sky Club® and while on board the aircraft.\nChecking In With Your Pet\nWhen you arrive at the airport, you will need to visit the Special Service Counter to check-in with your pet. At check-in, a Delta agent will ensure your pet and kennel meet the necessary requirements for your trip and collect the required pet fee. Remember to allow extra time at check-in for us to ensure your pet is ready for take-off.\n\nOnce you are checked in and have your cabin pet tag, you are ready to go through the security checkpoint where you are required to remove your pet from their kennel.\n\nAfter the security checkpoint, your pet must remain in their kennel while at the airport, unless they are in a designated relief area.\n\nDelta Sky Club® Pets\nKeep in mind that if you visit a Delta Sky Club with your pet, our policies are the same as the aircraft. For the comfort and safety of everyone, your pet must stay in its kennel. One of our representatives can assist you with locating a pet relief area, which is available to customers with pets and trained service animals at most airports.\nCarry-On Pet Fees\nCAD amount will be charged to exit Canada, while EUR amount will be charged to exit Europe.

Be sure to double-check before your flight.\n\nOn most flights, you can bring up to 2 pets per person. You must buy 2 seats if you’re bringing 2 pets. The second seat needs to be next to your assigned seat, so you can care for both pets.\n\nSome of our planes have limited space under the middle seat. We only allow one pet per person on these aircraft:\n\nA319\nA320\nA321neo\n737-800 and 737-8 (MAX 8)\n737-900 and 737-9 (MAX 9)\nWhere can I fly with my pet?\n\nBook trip\nMake sure your pet fits\nWhile there are no weight or breed limitations for pets, they must travel in either a hard-sided or soft-sided carrier. This carrier must fit under the seat in front of you or you cannot fly with your pet. The only animals allowed on planes without a pet carrier are service animals.\n\nHard-sided carrier\n\nHard-sided carriers.

Maximum dimensions are 11 inches high, 18 inches long and 11 inches wide.\nPrepping to fly\n\nGather paperwork\nSome countries don’t allow pets to travel at all. Others have strict rules for rabies vaccines. Make sure you have all your paperwork and proof of vaccination in order before you leave.\n\n\nBooking pet tickets\nAll you have to do is select “Travel with a pet” as a traveler during booking on united.com.

You cannot use travel credits to pay this fee.\n\nFor tickets purchased on or after 4/26/24, the fee is $150 each way for traveling with your pet.\n\n\nTraveler pro tips\nWe have a few recommendations to help you pack a pet-friendly travel kit:\n\nRemember to bring all the essentials to care for your pet while you’re still at the airport, including a collapsible water bowl, leash, treats and plastic bags.\nTo keep them calm on the flight, it always helps to have a favorite toy, blanket or pillow that smells familiar.\nAt the airport\nHere’s what you need to know once you get to the airport.\n\n\nChecking in\nCheck in for your flight at the ticket counter.

Other animals may be transported only as cargo.\n\nWe can take a limited number of pets on board our aircraft, so purchase of the service is subject to current availability. You can check it when you book your ticket on lot.com or later, up to 12 hours before departure, in Manage My Booking.\n\nIn order to ensure the comfort and safety of transported animals, we apply the standards of the International Air Transport Association (IATA).\n\nThe transport of animals (dogs, cats or ferrets) in a carrier on board the aircraft and in the hold is only possible for non-commercial purposes.\n\nTransporting animals for commercial purposes (for sale or transfer of ownership) entails additional costs due to the requirement for a customs agency among other things, hence such transport is only possible as Cargo.\n\nIf you travel with your pet on board an aircraft in a carrier or in the hold you bear the full legal and financial responsibility for it.\n\n1. Travel of dogs to the United States\nThe rules for transporting dogs to the United States have changed as of August 1, 2024. To transport your dog to the USA, please familiarize yourself with the new regulations introduced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nRead the requirements introduced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/importation/dogs/rabies-free-low-risk-countries.html\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/importation/dogs/us-vaccinated-high-risk-countries.html\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/importation/dogs/foreign-vaccinated-high-risk-countries.html\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/importation/dogs/high-risk-countries.html\nSend the documents, depending on the category established by the CDC, to us no later than 48 hours before departure. They are also required to be presented at the airport before the flight.\n\nAll dogs being transported to the United States must:\n\nshow no signs of illness,\nbe at least 6 months old,\nhave a microchip,\nhave proof of the necessary rabies vaccinations.\nSteps for booking dog transport service to the USA:\nCompile all required documents and submit them through the form.\nDocument verification will take up to 48 hours. After verification, you will receive an email informing you of the positive or negative outcome of the review.\nIn the case of a positive verification, contact us to purchase the service. You can do this via messaging apps or through our hotline.\nAfter purchasing the service, the dog will be added to your reservation. Remember to bring all the documents you previously submitted to us to the airport.\nATTENTION! The purchase of a dog transportation service to the United States is available no later than 48 hours before the flight, so we encourage you to contact us as soon as possible. The service is limited, and LOT Polish Airlines does not guarantee the availability of the service on every flight.\n\nPlease remember that due to CDC requirements, dogs traveling to the USA from high-risk countries can only be accepted on flights to three airports in the USA: New York (JFK), Los Angeles (LAX), and Miami (MIA).\n\nIn case of discrepancies in the submitted documentation, services will be denied.\n\nIf you already have an animal transport service to the United States in your booking, you still need to provide us with the documents required by the CDC.\n\nHow to quickly get approval to transport your dog? Here are a few tips!\nSubmit all the required documents in a single form. Don’t attach any documents that aren't listed on our website. For example, there's no need to send pictures of your dog.\nIf we inform you about missing documents, resubmit all the files through the form and complete any missing information.\nIf you're registering two dogs under the same reservation, submit all the documents in one form.\nDon’t send the CDC Dog Import Form receipt as a text file (.doc) – we need it in PDF or image format. Make sure that all the information on the CDC Dog Import Form receipt is visible, and don’t leave anything out.\nCarefully check the list of required documents and ensure nothing is missing. Only complete document submissions will be verified.\nFill out the forms and documents accurately – use the same information consistently (e.g., your dog’s microchip number, weight, arrival date in the US, reservation number, and age).\nBefore filling out the form, double-check the container dimensions. If the dimensions are incorrect, your request will be rejected.\nIf your CDC Dog Import Form confirmation shows that your dog has been in high-risk countries, be sure to send the required documents listed in the confirmation. They are necessary for verification, and without them, we won’t be able to accept your pet.\n\n2. Travel of cats to the United States\nTraveling with cats to the USA does not involve any additional restrictions. Standard documents are required at check-in, and in some cases, additional documents may be needed depending on the regulations of the specific country. Currently, the transport service for cats can only be booked through the Contact Center.",,,www.lot.com,

All small living creatures being transported as checked baggage must be transported in a container that allows oxygen to circulate and reach the creature (not applicable to guide dogs, hearing dogs). Any creatures which are not suited to a journey in the aircraft’s baggage hold will not be transported.\n5. Passengers should bear full responsibility for the small animals which they transport on a flight. China Southern Airlines will not be held liable for the illness, injury, or death of a small animal unless it is caused by the actions of the airline itself.\n\nPackaging requirements for living animals consigned for shipment\n1. To transport small animals, passengers must submit their applications at the time of reservation, and at least 72 hours before flight departure, and obtain the reply of China Southern Airlines.\n2. Some individual small aircraft cannot carry more than three small animals at a time. The actual restrictions on the number which may be carried on board must be confirmed with the Engineering Department of China Southern Airlines.\n3. Each passenger can only carry one small animal or one pair of birds in their checked baggage (depending on the entry and exit regulations of the departing and destination countries). Each small animal should be placed in a single cage, while a pair of birds can be placed in the same cage.\n4. The cage size used to transport a single small animal must not be larger than 90x60x66cm or smaller than 5x15x20cm. The maximum weight should not exceed 32kg.\n5. If the baggage storage area on the aircraft model used for a flight is not suitable for transporting small living creatures, passengers cannot apply to have their animals transported. Ground personnel must check that the aircraft model being used for a flight is suitable for carrying a small living creature on board before agreeing to do so.\n6. China Southern Airlines cannot currently carry small living creatures on connecting flights.\n7. Small living creatures brought on board by passengers must be in good health, harmless, clean, and not have a pungent odor. Pregnant animals may not be brought on board.\n8. Passengers should take their small animals to the airport for check-in 90 minutes before their flight departure time.\n9. Passengers who check in a dog or cat must sign a waiver of liability for the transportation of their animal.\n\nRequired Documentation\n1. China Domestic flights: Passengers must present an animal quarantine certificate from a quarantine department at county (or regional) level or above.\n2. Hong Kong/ Macau/ Taiwan, China/ International flights:\n  a. “Certificate of Quarantine” and “Certificate of Rabies Immunization” issued by the department responsible for plant and animal immunization in the People's Republic of China;\n  b. A departure and arrivals card or transit permit;\n  c. Any additional documentation required by the destination or transiting countries (please refer to TIM for national regulations).\nNote: Some airports (such as Hong Kong, China) only allow small living creatures to arrive or depart as cargo. Please check this carefully before you depart.\n\nRequirements for pet carriers\nSmall animals must be kept in a suitable and sturdy carrier made of metal, tough plastic, or wood. The carrier used must also meet the following requirements:\n\n1. The carrier should be used specifically for checking in pets onto a flight. It must be made of sturdy materials, with a fixed top and ventilation on at least three sides. The door must be lockable and made of metal to prevent pets from escaping.\n2. All parts and accessories of the carrier (including the nuts, latches, rivets, and locks, etc.) must be strong and in good working order.\n3. The base of the crate should be flat and must be able to be kept stationary on an even surface. If a crate with wheels is used, its wheels should be fixed or removed in advance to prevent the crate from moving.\n4. Small animals suffering from an infectious disease will not be accepted for transport. For international transport of small animals, passengers should present the Quarantine Certificate and Rabies Vaccination Certificate issued by the Animal and Plant Quarantine Department of the People’s Republic of China, an Entry/Exit or Transit Permit as well as any other documents required by the country which the small animal will enter or transit through.\n5. Cages used for animal transportation must have an absorbent mat (such as a towel or blanket) placed on the bottom to prevent urine and feces from coming into contact with other baggage.\n\nRequirements for packaging pet carriers\n1. When land-based animals such as dogs and cats are checked in, a protective net should be used to line and fasten their carrier before the animal is placed inside.\n2. When a packing belt is used, it should bind the carrier evenly in a grid shape with spacing of between 20 to 30cm used.\n3. To prevent the carrier tipping over and agitating your pet, the carrier should be packed using binding belts on its sides in a vertical and horizontal style. To make the package more secure, these belts should pass through the door and protective grid on the carrier. The belts going through the grids should be even to securely fasten the door, the body, and the protective net.\n\nFeeding and Exercise\nPassengers who have checked an animal onto a flight should remember to feed, water, and exercise their animal at every stop during the entire length of their journey.\n\nApplication Procedures\nCharges for small animals:\n\nBaggage sales take effect from May 20, 2019 (inclusive).\n\nDomestic flights:\nThe weight of small animals, their containers, and food to be carried shall not be counted into the passenger's free baggage allowance and shall be charged as excess baggage.\n\nInternational flights:\nActual shipping weight (including the weight of the small animal, its container, and food to be carried) Charging Standard (RMB) Charging Standard (USD) Charging Standard (EUR)\n2KG≤ Small Animal as Baggage ≤8KG 1380 200 190\n8KG＜ Small Animal as Baggage ≤23KG 2100 300 280\n23KG＜ Small Animal as Baggage ≤32KG 3500 500 470\nThe transportation charge for small animals is calculated separately, which shall not be included in free baggage allowance nor billed as excess baggage.\nUSD applies to the transportation of small animals originating from the United States;\nEUR applies to the transportation of small animals originating from the Eurozone;\nRMB applies to the transportation of small animals originating from the countries not mentioned above.

Exceptionally, on flights from Moldova and Ukraine to the United States, only one carrier per passenger (with a maximum of two animals of the same breed or siblings) is permitted. If a passenger states that they are allergic to pets prior to the flight and provides a valid doctor's report, the pet's entry into the passenger cabin is subject to the following conditions: According to the rules of the United States Department of Transportation: When a passenger with allergies and a passenger with a service dog wish to board the same aircraft, the passenger with the service dog has priority and does not require a reservation. Admission to a flight is determined according to reservation priority in cases where a passenger with allergies and a passenger with a pet wish to board the same aircraft. Fees and restrictions for bringing pets aboard AnadoluJet flights may vary. Important considerations: Passengers traveling with pets in the aircraft cabin must keep the animals in a carrier or cage under the seat in front of them.

Check if you can buy additional food at your destination. For remote locations, you may need to bring enough food for the entire trip.</li>\n</ul>","Bringing your fur baby for an adventure can make your getaway fun for the entire family — with a little bit of planning. Because while you and your two-legged companions may be well versed in take-off and landing protocols, your pet likely isn’t. Use the following tips to make your pet’s (and your) vacation a smooth one. Check the Pet Policy. They vary from airline to airline. As a pet-friendly airline, Kenmore Air welcomes dogs and cats on board. However, for the safety of its passengers, it limits one pet per flight. (See website for additional restrictions.) Review the International Regulations. If you are flying out of the country, pet immunization and a health certificate will likely be required. Make Reservations Over the Phone. You’ll always want to make your pet’s reservation before arriving at the airport to ensure the airline can accommodate your four-legged loved one. Scope Out the Pet Area in Advance. While making your reservation, be sure to ask if there’s an area where your pet can relieve themselves before the flight. This is a great way to avoid any unwanted accidents. Have a Secure Leash. Always keep your pet leashed while flying. Even the most well-behaved animals can act unpredictably in new situations. Having a secure hold of them is essential to both their safety and your own. Try to Get Your Pet Some Exercise Before the Flight. Just like for humans, exercise is a great stress reliever for your pet. If possible, take your pet on a walk prior to the flight so that they—and you—can expend some energy. Plan for Water & Food. It’s not guaranteed your destination will have a dog-friendly restaurant, so plan accordingly by packing a food and water bowl, along with at least enough food for one meal. Check to make sure you can buy additional food at your destination. If you are flying somewhere remote, you may need to bring enough food for the entire trip.",,,www.kenmoreair.com,

We do not allow pregnant pets to travel with us to ensure their safety. Also, do inform us if your pet has given birth in the last 48 hours. We allow all breeds of dogs and cats to fly in the cabin. However, certain breeds, such as snub-nosed or flat-faced pets, may be at risk if carried in the cargo compartment. Therefore, they are not permitted to fly in the cargo compartment.
