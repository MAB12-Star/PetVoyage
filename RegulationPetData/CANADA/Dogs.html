        <li>Veterinary certificate</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Valid Rabies Vaccination Certificate</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Have the animal vaccinated against rabies within a specified period of time</li>
        <li>Present the vaccination record to a <a href="https://inspection.canada.ca" target="_blank">CFIA Animal Health Office</a></li>

    <h2>Humane Transport of Animals Regulations</h2>
    <p>Canada has strong regulations in place to help prevent injury and suffering of all animals during transport. Learn more about the <a href="https://inspection.canada.ca/humane-transport" target="_blank">legal requirements for transporting animals humanely in Canada</a>.</p>

    <h2>Advance Notice of Arrival</h2>
    <p>Some animals may require inspection by the CFIA at ports of entry into Canada. A CFIA inspector is not on duty at all times at ports of entry and may be called when required. Importers should use the <a href="https://inspection.canada.ca/airs" target="_blank">Automated Import Reference System</a> to determine if a CFIA inspection is required. If a CFIA inspection is required, importers should make these arrangements in advance of their arrival by contacting the CFIA district office closest to their first point of entry into Canada to schedule the inspection. It is the responsibility of the importer to contact the CFIA in advance of travel to ensure that the inspection can be carried out without delays.</p>

    <h2>Air Transport Requirements</h2>
    <p>Airlines may require additional documentation or have additional requirements when travelling with an animal by air. Please check with your airline to determine whether you meet its requirements.</p>
    <p>You should be aware of the <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/cargo/live-animals/" target="_blank">Live Animal Regulations (LAR)</a> issued by the International Air Transport Association (IATA).</p>

    <h2>Shipments That Don't Meet CFIA's Requirements</h2>
    <p>If a shipment does not meet Canada's import requirements, the situation will be reviewed and a decision made regarding the animal's eligibility to enter Canada. Depending on the facts of the case and the non-compliance(s) with CFIA requirements, the animal may be ordered to be removed from Canada, fines may be applied, or legal actions may be pursued.</p>

    <h2>Inspection Fees, Taxes, and Duties</h2>
    <p>All personal pet dogs, commercial dogs over 8 months of age, and domestic (pet) cats that are imported into Canada will have a documentary inspection by the <a href="https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca" target="_blank">Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)</a> to ensure the animal's rabies vaccination is valid and the animal description matches. All assistance dogs imported into Canada will have a documentary inspection by the CBSA to ensure the animal meets the criteria and has the appropriate certification. The CBSA will also visually inspect the animal to ensure that there are no visible signs of illness or injury. The CBSA may contact the CFIA when veterinary guidance or expertise is needed. In certain cases, the animal may be referred to CFIA for further inspection. Additional fees for the cost of CFIA inspection will apply.</p>
    <p>For fee amounts refer to the <a href="https://inspection.canada.ca/fees" target="_blank">CFIA Fees Notice</a>. All fees must be paid at the time of inspection. Any applicable taxes or duties are calculated by the CBSA.</p>

    <h2>Microchip or Tattoo Requirements</h2>
    <p>Canada does not require microchip or tattoo identification for domestic dogs imported as personal pets or domestic cats. However, dogs under 8 months of age imported under the commercial category (dogs for retail sale, breeding purposes, show or exhibition, scientific research, dogs in 'special training status', and dogs destined for adoption and/or animal welfare organization) must be identified by an electronic microchip.</p>

    <h2>Pet Food</h2>
    <p>Personal imports of pet food from the United States are allowed under specific conditions. Personal imports of pet foods from other countries are subject to a case-by-case evaluation before arriving in Canada, with no guarantee of a successful outcome. To request a permit to import pet food, visit <a href="https://inspection.canada.ca" target="_blank">MyCFIA</a>.</p>
