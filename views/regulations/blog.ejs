                    <img src="/images/movetocdmx.jpg" alt="Pet family traveling to Mexico City" class="img-fluid" />

                    <p>After nine months of planning and navigating some unexpected setbacks, my family — which includes two dogs, a cat, and two humans — finally made it to Mexico City (CDMX)! This was a journey filled with learning, and I hope sharing my experience helps make someone else’s pet-travel adventure a little smoother.</p>

                    <h2>Why We Chose Mexico</h2>
                    <p>Mexico wasn’t just our destination for its vibrant culture, beautiful language, and incredible climate; it also happens to be one of the easier countries to import pets into. Knowing this, we felt more confident making it our first stop as we plan to continue traveling through Central America next year.</p>

                    <h2>Flying with Pets: Why Volaris Was Our Airline</h2>
                    <p>Coming from Sacramento, CA, Volaris was our only option for a direct flight to Mexico City. An added benefit? Volaris doesn’t require a health certificate for pets on their flights, saving us from the hassle and expense of getting certificates that cost around $300 per pet and are valid for only five days. This small detail made a big difference in our planning and budget.</p>

                    <h2>Preparing for the Flight</h2>
                    <p>Volaris’ pet policy is well-outlined on their website, and I didn’t encounter any surprises when we flew. However, I recommend visiting a Volaris counter before your flight to confirm everything is in order. Airline policies can change, and it’s always better to double-check.</p>

                    <p>One notable issue was the carrier size listed for in-cabin pets. The website claims carriers must be no taller than 7.5 inches, but that’s an impractical dimension to find. I used a hard-sided carrier that was 10 inches tall, and it fit perfectly under the seat with my cat. Don’t be afraid to test a slightly larger carrier if it’s safe and fits the airline’s other requirements.</p>

                    <h2>Medication for the Journey</h2>
                    <p>My cat isn’t a fan of leaving the house, so my vet prescribed gabapentin for the flight. This medication was a lifesaver. It kept her calm and relaxed without the concerning side effects like slowed heart rate that some other medications might cause. I’ll definitely consider giving gabapentin to my dogs for our next flight based on how well it worked for my cat.</p>

                    <h2>Helpful Tips for Traveling with Pets</h2>
                    <p>Traveling with pets doesn’t have to be as stressful as it sounds. Here are some tips that made our journey easier:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Freeze Water for Fresh Hydration:</strong> By freezing water in advance, your pets will have access to cool, fresh water throughout the trip. Airlines do allow water and food for pets, so take advantage of this!</li>
                        <li><strong>Test Your Carrier Dimensions:</strong> If you’re flying Volaris (or another airline), double-check the carrier dimensions in person. Online measurements aren’t always accurate.</li>
                        <li><strong>Plan Ahead but Stay Flexible:</strong> While months of planning helped us feel prepared, flexibility was key in dealing with last-minute changes.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                    <p>The entire process turned out to be much easier than I had feared during those stressful weeks leading up to the flight. I hope this information helps ease the stress for someone else embarking on a similar journey. If you’re traveling with pets, know that it’s possible to make it work — and it might not be as overwhelming as it seems.</p>

                    <p>Now that we’re settling into life in CDMX, our next step is finalizing my temporary visa. This marks the beginning of a new chapter for us, and we’re excited to continue exploring Mexico and beyond!</p>
