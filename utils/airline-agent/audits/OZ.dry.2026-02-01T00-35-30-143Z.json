One pet may travel in the cabin per adult; up to two pets may be checked as baggage, subject to aircraft/route limits. In-cabin pets (pet + carrier) must be 7 kg or less, with a hard/soft carrier not exceeding 45 × 32 × 21 cm (soft carriers may be up to 26 cm tall but must compress to 21 cm). Pets must remain in the carrier; only water may be given. Business Class has no underseat space (except on A321); crew will guide carrier placement during taxi/takeoff/landing.

Crates must be sturdy, lockable, leak-proof with absorbent pad, and well ventilated, allowing the pet to stand and move. Birds’ cages should be covered. Restrictions: pets under 16 weeks, sedated pets, pregnant or foul-smelling pets, dangerous breeds, and birds of prey are not accepted. Checked transport of short-nosed (brachycephalic) breeds is not allowed (effective July 1, 2019).
