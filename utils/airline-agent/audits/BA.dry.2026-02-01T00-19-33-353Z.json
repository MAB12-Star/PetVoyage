      "Practical next steps: If you need to move a pet on a BA itinerary, plan on arranging transport through the referenced partners; if travelling with a qualified assistance dog, complete BA's Open Doors Organization registration and any route-specific requirements (e.g., CDC form for US; UK ARC pre-approval for UK arrivals) within the timelines above.",
