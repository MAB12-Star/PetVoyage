      "In-cabin pets: Not permitted. Aer Lingus only accepts dogs as service animals in the cabin; pets and emotional support animals (ESAs) are not accepted on board. Service animals in training are not accepted.",

      "Transatlantic specifics (North America): All pets to/from North America must travel in the hold (cargo).",
      "From North America to Ireland: Dublin (DUB) must be the final destination on Aer Lingus; animals cannot be shipped on Fridays or Saturdays; a compliance check with Ireland’s Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is required for pets arriving from the USA.",
      "Aircraft restriction: No live animals may be carried on A321neo LR aircraft (cargo holds not ventilated).",
      "Aer Lingus Regional (operated by Emerald Airlines): Transportation of pets is not permitted if any part of the journey is on Aer Lingus Regional.",
      "Service dogs (trained) — general cabin rules: Dogs only; must be harnessed/leashed/tethered, clean, and well‑behaved. Cannot sit in exit rows or block aisles; must fit at your feet/under the seat or in your lap (size permitting). In business class, lie‑flat feature may be forfeited to accommodate the dog on the floor. Travel is free if the dog fits in the allotted space; otherwise an extra seat may be required. Final approval occurs at the airport based on fit.",
      "Service dogs (trained) — restricted breeds: Certain breeds must be securely muzzled and led on a strong leash (list provided by Aer Lingus: American Pit Bull Terrier; Bull Mastiff; Doberman Pinscher; English Bull Terrier; German Shepherd/Alsatian; Japanese Akita).",
      "Service dogs — route-specific documentation/limits (USA/Canada): Aer Lingus accommodates trained service dogs to/from the USA and Canada (including same‑itinerary connections). US flights require the U.S. DOT Service Animal Air Transportation Form; flights of 8+ hours also require the U.S. DOT Relief Attestation. Limit of two service dogs per passenger on these itineraries.",

Customers with affected breeds should confirm acceptance with Aer Lingus before booking due to this inconsistency.",
      "Fees — pets shipped as cargo: Pricing, weight/container limits, and acceptance are handled via IAG Cargo/pet agent (not priced on aerlingus.com).",
      "Fees — trained service dogs: Carried free of charge if fitting within the allotted space; an additional seat may be required (paid) if the dog cannot be safely accommodated.",
