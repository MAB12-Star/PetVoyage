A maximum of two pet containers are allowed in the cabin per flight, and only one pet carrier per passenger. Pets must remain in the carrier at all times. No pet fee is charged.",
      "Pet carrier rules: Carrier must fit under the seat and be large enough for the pet to stand, lie down, and turn around naturally. Maximum carrier size: 24 in (L) x 16 in (W) x 10 in (H). The pet carrier counts as a carry-on item for allowance purposes. Passengers with a pet carrier cannot sit in an emergency exit row.",
      "Additional seating restriction detail: Pets in carriers are not permitted in a row immediately behind a bulkhead or adjacent to an emergency exit.",
      "Breed/species restrictions (pets): Contour will not accept as in-cabin pets dogs of the Pit Bull breed, snakes, other reptiles, ferrets, rodents, or spiders. Only domesticated cats and dogs are accepted as pets.",
      "Service animals: Only dogs that are individually trained to perform tasks for a qualified person with a disability are accepted as service animals; they are carried free of charge. One service animal per passenger; it must fit on the lap, at the feet, or under the seat and cannot block the aisle. Explosives/drug detection and search-and-rescue dogs on official duty are also accepted without charge (documentation required).",
      "Service animal documentation: Passengers must submit the U.S. DOT Service Animal Air Transportation Form at least 48 hours before departure and may be asked to present it during travel.",
      "ESAs and other animals: Emotional support animals, comfort/companion animals, and service animals in training are not considered service animals. They may travel only under the pet policy (as in-cabin pets) if they meet pet requirements.",
      "Fees: Pets — No fee (when traveling as in-cabin pets and meeting Contour’s requirements). Service animals — No fee.",
      "Cargo/checked pets: Public pet policy addresses in-cabin pets only; no dedicated program for transporting pets as checked baggage or air cargo is published. Contract notes an animal causing disturbance may be removed and carried as cargo at the passenger’s expense, but no general cargo pet acceptance details are provided. Travelers should call Customer Experience to confirm options.",
      "Health/entry compliance: Passengers are responsible for complying with applicable laws and for any required health/rabies certificates; Contour is not liable if a pet is refused passage by authorities."

      "Consistency: The Traveling with Pets page sets the carrier size (24x16x10 in) and two-pet-container-per-flight cap, and states pets travel at no charge. The Contract of Carriage adds specific species/breed exclusions for pets and confirms service-animal rules. Use both sources when advising customers.",
      "Booking tip: Because pet space is capped at two containers per flight and must be reserved by phone, advise booking early to secure a spot."
