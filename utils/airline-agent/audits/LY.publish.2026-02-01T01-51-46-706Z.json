      "Species and entry limits: In cabin, EL AL accepts only dogs/cats/birds, subject to EL AL baggage rules and destination authorities. Israel permits up to 2 pets per passenger entering the country. (elal.com: https://www.elal.com/it/PassengersInfo/Baggage/Pages/Pets.aspx)",
      "In-cabin allowance and carrier: Weight up to 8 kg (animal + carrier) may travel in cabin; above 8 kg must go in hold. Container must be soft- or hard-sided, leak-proof, lined with absorbent material, and fit under seat: max 41 × 38 × 19 cm in Economy; 30 × 30 × 19 cm in Business. Up to 2 pets may share one carrier if combined weight stays within the 8 kg limit and they can be safely kept together. Carrier must remain closed for the entire flight and cannot be placed on the lap during takeoff/landing. Advance request to EL AL reservations is required, providing pet weight and carrier dimensions. (elal.com: https://www.elal.com/zh/PassengersInfo/Baggage/Pages/Pets.aspx)",
      "Cabin class/aircraft limitations: Pets may be carried in Business Class only on Boeing 737 aircraft and on the upper deck of Boeing 747-400; not permitted in Business on 777/767. (elal.com: https://www.elal.com/it/PassengersInfo/Baggage/Pages/Pets.aspx)",
      "Routes/destination restrictions: No pets in the cabin on flights to/from London Heathrow and Luton (UK rules). For London (Heathrow only), Johannesburg, Hong Kong and Australia, pets are carried only in the hold and must be handled as cargo with an airway bill (AWB), even if the owner is on the same flight. (elal.com: https://www.elal.com/it/PassengersInfo/Baggage/Pages/Pets.aspx)",
      "Checked/hold transport requirements: For hold transport, use a strong crate approved by EL AL, with ventilation openings on all four sides, a securely closing door, and openings not large enough for the animal to get nose/paws stuck. For flights longer than 12 hours, include a water container (food container recommended). Two animals up to 14 kg each may share a crate; up to three young animals (≤6 months, each up to 14 kg) may share one crate. (elal.com: https://www.elal.com/it/PassengersInfo/Baggage/Pages/Pets.aspx)",
      "Hold temperature advisory: On Boeing 787 aircraft, hold temperature may drop to about 5°C; owner must consult a veterinarian to confirm the animal can tolerate these conditions. EL AL disclaims liability for damage/death due to sensitivity to hold conditions. (elal.com: https://www.elal.com/it/PassengersInfo/Baggage/Pages/Pets.aspx)",
      "Fees (per direction; separate from baggage allowance): Up to 8 kg: USD 100; 9–50 kg: USD 200; 51–100 kg: USD 400; Over 100 kg: handled by EL AL Cargo. Payment at EL AL airport ticket office or EL AL office; fees are separate from baggage allowance; codeshares not eligible; passengers must arrange payment with other airlines for onward sectors. One-way tickets may require payment for both directions if applicable. (elal.com: https://www.elal.com/it/PassengersInfo/Baggage/Pages/Pets.aspx)",
      "Documents: Health/vaccination certificates and entry permits required by transit/destination authorities are mandatory. For import to Israel, specific veterinary import permit rules apply. (elal.com: https://www.elal.com/it/PassengersInfo/Baggage/Pages/Pets.aspx)",
      "Service animals and ESAs: Guide dogs, including “emotional support” animals, accompanying passengers with special needs are transported free of charge in the cabin, subject to conditions. Notify EL AL at least 48 hours before the flight and (for London) register 14 days in advance with Heathrow Animal Reception Centre. A veterinary authorization confirming the dog is not dangerous is required; for flights longer than 8 hours, a veterinary statement that the dog poses no hygiene risk is required. Muzzle/harness should be available if needed. For safety risks, EL AL may transport the dog in the hold at no extra charge. (elal.com: https://www.elal.com/it/PassengersInfo/Baggage/Pages/Pets.aspx)",
      "Cargo process (when required): For destinations requiring AWB (UK, Hong Kong, South Africa, Australia) or very heavy animals, EL AL Cargo’s Direct Sales handles booking. Contact Cargo roughly two weeks before travel; provide shipper/consignee details, crate dimensions, and pet weight; present pet, crate, and signed veterinary documents three days before flight for checks and payment. (elal.com: https://www.elal.com/en/Cargo/Direct-Sales/Pages/Animals-Transport.aspx)",
      "Additional destination notes: Bangkok requires a copy of the veterinary permit attached to the crate; France prohibits entry of pet food; Romania bans commercial import of animals (exceptions for passenger-accompanied animals with proper documents). Birds and eggs (except chickens) are not allowed to the UK without a permit. (elal.com: https://www.elal.com/it/PassengersInfo/Baggage/Pages/Pets.aspx)",
      "Conditions of Carriage baseline: EL AL is not obligated to transport animals (except guide dogs). If accepted, animals and their crate/food are excess baggage and charged accordingly. Guide dogs travel free in addition to any baggage allowance; EL AL may refuse a guide dog on safety/health grounds.

Local import rules may apply; confirm with EL AL/EL AL Cargo for specific breeds. (elal.com: https://www.elal.com/it/PassengersInfo/Baggage/Pages/Pets.aspx)",
