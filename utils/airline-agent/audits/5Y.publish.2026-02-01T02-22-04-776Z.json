    "PetPolicySummary": "Atlas Air (charter) accepts service animals in the cabin at no charge; they must remain on the floor and cannot occupy a seat. Certain accommodations, including flights over 8 hours, require 48 hours’ advance notice. Atlas does not publish a general in-cabin program for non-service pets; non-service animals may be accepted as checked baggage or shipped as cargo at Atlas’s discretion. Live animals are transported as special cargo under IATA Live Animals Regulations and should be arranged via Atlas’s Special Loads Request portal. Health/vaccination certificates and entry/transit documents are required. No Atlas-published breed bans or brachycephalic-specific prohibitions were found; acceptance is case-by-case.",
