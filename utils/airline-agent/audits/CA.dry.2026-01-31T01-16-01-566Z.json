      "PetPolicySummary": "Pets as Checked Baggage: Air China only accepts domesticated cats and dogs as checked baggage; no pets are allowed in the cabin. Aggressive breeds, snub-nosed (brachycephalic) breeds, pregnant pets, pets less than 8 weeks old, nursing pets, pets that have given birth within 7 days, or sick animals are not accepted. Certain aircraft models (A319, A320, 737-8 MAX, ARJ21-700) lack oxygen-equipped cargo compartments and cannot transport pets. Passengers are fully liable for their pets, and Air China is not responsible for illness, injury, or death unless related to airline negligence. Carriage Requirements: Pets must be pre-approved for transport when reservations are made. Only one pet per passenger is allowed, and the total weight (including the container, food, and water) must not exceed 32 kg. Passengers must check in their pets at least 120 minutes before departure and sign a liability waiver. Fees (per container, one way): 2–8 kg USD 600; >8–23 kg USD 800; >23–32 kg USD 1,200 (confirm at booking; fees may change). Transport Documents: Domestic flights within China require a quarantine certificate from AQSIQ. International flights require AQSIQ certification and compliance with the destination/transit country’s regulations. Quarantine Requirements (entering China): Pets must meet China Customs regulations, including valid quarantine and rabies vaccination certificates and ISO 11784/11785-compliant microchips; a 30-day quarantine may apply with certain exemptions for designated origins or qualified guide/hearing/search-and-rescue dogs. Pet Carrier Requirements: Carriers must meet specific material and structural requirements, including adequate ventilation, solid floors, wire-mesh-covered openings, and secure locking mechanisms; dimensions must allow the pet to stand, turn, and lie down naturally; food/water containers must be fixed and water refillable from outside. U.S. Notice: Effective February 1, 2025, Air China has temporarily suspended transportation of all dogs to the United States, including service dogs; verify status before travel. Transportation of Service Dogs: Trained service dogs for passengers with qualifying disabilities may travel in the cabin when requirements are met (fees waived); U.S.-bound flights are subject to the dog suspension noted above. For full details, contact Air China or consult official notices.",
