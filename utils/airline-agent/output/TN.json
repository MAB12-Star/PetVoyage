You will find all the necessary information here to help you prepare for your trip including transportation rules and conditions, fares, and the list of prohibited animals. Pets in the cabin: Air Tahiti Nui allows dogs and cats to be carried in the cabin accompanied by their owners on the following flights only: Los Angeles / Seattle â Paris, Paris - Los Angeles / Seattle, Papeete - Los Angeles / Seattle, Papeete - Paris. Conditions for acceptance and transport of animals in the cabin: Only cats and dogs are accepted (at least 4 months old and vaccinated). The combined weight of the animal and its carrier must be less than or equal to 8 Kg (about 17.6 pounds).

The pet carrierâs maximum dimensions should be no larger than L40cm x W35cm x H20cm (L15.7in x W13.7 x H7.9in). One pet carrier is allowed per passenger, capable of accommodating up to two (2) small pets, provided that the total weight limit is respected and there is enough space in the pet carrier for these animals to move easily. Availability is subject to quota per flight. For any other animal inquiries, please contact our CARGO department. Mandatory documents: Up-to-date vaccination records. Valid Health Certificate issued by a veterinarian. The certificate must include the weight, size, and breed of the animal.

Ensure compliance with entry requirements for departure, transit, and destination countries. Note: Starting August 1, 2024, dogs traveling to or in transit through the United States must meet new travel requirements, including being at least 6 months and having all required documentation. For more information, please visit the CDC website. Attention: Failure to comply with these rules may result in your dog being denied boarding.

The purchase of a ticket for your pet is no longer required. Prohibited animals: As defined by the French Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the transportation of dogs that may be dangerous, i.e., category 1 (attack dogs) and 2 (guard and defense dogs), is prohibited on board our aircraft.

Conditions for acceptance and transport of Service Animals: A maximum of two (2) service dogs or one (1) service cat per passenger is allowed. The service animal must be at least 4 months old. The animal must be identified by a tattoo or microchip. During the flight, the service animal must remain by its owner's feet or on their lap, without encroaching on another passenger's space.
