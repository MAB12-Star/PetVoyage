  "PetPolicySummary": "Condor accepts only dogs and cats, subject to limited capacity and confirmed reservation, and only on Condor-operated nonstop flights. One animal per carrier; typically one pet per passenger. In cabin (PETC): the pet must remain in a closed, IATA-compliant, ventilated, waterproof, lockable carrier under the seat, with max size 55 x 40 x 20 cm and max total weight (pet + carrier) 8 kg. The carrier counts in addition to normal cabin baggage. PETC is not permitted in Business Class on A330neo aircraft, at exit rows, or behind partitions. Reservations are accepted up to 24 hours before departure, and passengers must bring the completed Live Animal Acceptance Checklist. In-cabin fees vary by zone (e.g., USA/Canada Zone 5: USD 115 when pre-registered; higher at airport). In the cargo hold (AVIH): only on direct flights and bookable up to 48 hours before departure; provide animal+crate weight, crate dimensions, and dog breed. Crates must comply with IATA LAR, be escape-proof with a watertight base lined with absorbent material, and include water/food containers; the animal must be able to stand without head/ears touching the roof and turn/lie naturally. Ventilated holds are approx. 10°C on short/medium haul and 18–23°C on long haul. Cargo fees vary by zone and crate size (e.g., USA/Canada Zone 5: USD 185/310 when pre-registered; higher at airport). Destination restrictions apply: no pets at all to/from Antigua; Barbados (cruise flights only); China; Dubai; Great Britain; Jamaica; Mauritius; Panama; Sharjah; South Africa. Hold embargo (cabin may be allowed) for Beirut; Egypt; Erevan; Las Vegas (May–September); Phoenix; Sulaymaniyah. Listed fighting dog types and brachycephalic breeds (snub-nosed dogs and cats) are not accepted, including mixed breeds. Age/entry rules apply (e.g., within the EU at least 4 months old; from unlisted third countries to the EU at least 7 months). On US routes, CDC rules apply (e.g., Dog Import Form; exclusions for dogs from high-risk rabies countries). Only trained assistance/service dogs are accepted in the cabin free of charge; ESAs are not recognized and must travel as pets.",
