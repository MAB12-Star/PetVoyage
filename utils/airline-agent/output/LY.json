  "PetPolicySummary": "EL AL accepts dogs, cats, and birds. Small pets may travel in the cabin if the pet plus carrier weighs up to 8 kg and the carrier fits under the seat (Economy max 41 × 38 × 19 cm; Business max 30 × 30 × 19 cm). The pet must remain in a leakproof semi‑rigid or rigid carrier lined with absorbent material; up to two pets may share one carrier if within the limit. In‑cabin transport is not permitted to/from London Heathrow or Luton, or on flights to Johannesburg, Hong Kong, or Australia (also not from Johannesburg to Israel); on these routes animals must go in the hold/cargo. Pets over the in‑cabin limit travel in the hold (about 9–100 kg with crate) or as cargo if over 100 kg or when required by destination (UK/Hong Kong/South Africa/Australia). Fees each way: up to 8 kg (in cabin) USD 100; 9–50 kg USD 200; 51–100 kg USD 400; over 100 kg via cargo. Brachycephalic dog/cat breeds are not accepted as baggage or cargo. Crates for hold must meet EL AL standards; on B787, hold temperatures may drop to around 5°C. Required documents (health/vaccination certificates and permits) must comply with the destination’s rules; up to two pets per passenger may enter Israel. Guide dogs and emotional support dogs for passengers with special needs may travel in the cabin free of charge, with advance notice and documentation, subject to conditions.",
