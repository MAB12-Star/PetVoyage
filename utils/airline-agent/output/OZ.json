Reserve pet travel in advance: at least 24 business hours before domestic departures and 48 business hours before international departures. Without prior approval, pets will be refused. In-cabin: 1 pet per adult passenger; pet + carrier must be 7 kg or less and the carrier must not exceed 45 × 32 × 21 cm (soft carriers may be up to 26 cm tall if they compress to 21 cm). Pets must remain inside the carrier; water only. One pair of birds per cage is permitted; limited exceptions allow two young littermates (<6 months) or a mother with young in one carrier. Business Class has under-seat stowage limits (not available except on A321); crew will guide carrier placement for taxi, takeoff, and landing. Checked baggage: accepted if over cabin limits and if pet + crate ≤45 kg, crate L+W+H ≤285 cm, and height ≤84 cm; numbers may be limited by aircraft/route. Some destinations restrict to 32 kg. Crates must be strong, lockable, leak-proof, ventilated; birds’ cages should be covered. Restrictions: pets <16 weeks, sedated, pregnant, foul-smelling, ferocious/dangerous breeds, and birds of prey are not accepted. Checked transport of short-nosed breeds is not allowed (since July 1, 2019). Fees apply on top of baggage; overseas airports may levy taxes. U.S. segments: only trained service dogs are recognized; DOT forms may be required. From Aug 1, 2024, dogs entering the U.S. must be ≥6 months, microchipped, and meet CDC documentation requirements.",
