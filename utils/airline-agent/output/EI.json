  "inCargoDetails": "Cats and dogs must be shipped as cargo via a pet agent/IAG Cargo; animals presented at Aer Lingus passenger check-in will not be accepted. No live animals are permitted on A321neo LR aircraft, and pets are not accepted on any Aer Lingus Regional (Emerald Airlines) segments. Transatlantic: all pets to/from North America must travel in the hold. From North America to Ireland, Dublin (DUB) must be the final Aer Lingus destination; animals cannot be shipped on Fridays or Saturdays; an Irish Department of Agriculture compliance check is required for arrivals from the USA. Rates, container specs, weight/size limits, and breed acceptance are managed by IAG Cargo/pet agents—confirm before booking.",
  "serviceAnimalDetails": "Dogs only. Must be trained to perform tasks for a person with a disability; service animals in training are not accepted. The dog must be harnessed/leashed/tethered, clean, well-behaved, and fit at your feet/under the seat or in your lap (subject to size); cannot block aisles or occupy exit rows. In business class, the lie-flat feature may be forfeited to accommodate the dog on the floor. Travel is free if the dog fits safely in the allotted space; otherwise, an additional seat may be required. Final approval is at the airport based on fit. USA/Canada itineraries: US DOT Service Animal Air Transportation Form required (and Relief Attestation for flights 8+ hours to/from the USA); up to two service dogs per passenger permitted. Europe: Typically one service dog per passenger free of charge; accreditation via IGDF/ADI-affiliated organisation required. Breed control: Aer Lingus lists certain breeds that must be securely muzzled and led on a strong leash (American Pit Bull Terrier; Bull Mastiff; Doberman Pinscher; English Bull Terrier; German Shepherd/Alsatian; Japanese Akita). Important: Published information is inconsistent—one Aer Lingus source states restricted breeds cannot be accepted at all. Confirm acceptance with Aer Lingus Special Assistance before booking.",
  "carrierCargoDetails": "Book pet transport through a pet agent/IAG Cargo; Aer Lingus will not accept animals at passenger check-in. Availability and acceptance depend on routing and aircraft type (no live animals on A321neo LR). For North America itineraries and Irish arrivals, additional routing/day-of-week and compliance requirements apply. Contact IAG Cargo for crate specifications, pricing, and breed acceptance. Note: Aer Lingus Regional segments cannot carry pets.",
